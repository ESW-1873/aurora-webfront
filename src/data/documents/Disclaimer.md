Hologram is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that can be used to measure people's credit; Hologram contains a set of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and is free and open source. It is currently in alpha, and there are various risks involved in managing CREDIT tokens. You are responsible for your own scrutiny of the Hologram mechanism and understand the fees and risks involved.

The Hologram protocol will allow access from any contract in the future. Bridges, Inc. developed the initial code for the Hologram protocol and currently manages the contracts to be accessed, but we will gradually transition to a community-driven system with Hologram governance token holders. No developer or entity involved in creating the Hologram protocol will be liable for any claims or damages related to the Hologram protocol, including but not limited to direct, indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages, or loss of profits, tokens, or anything else of value.
